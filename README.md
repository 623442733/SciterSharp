ACTUAL SCITER VERSION: 3.3.0.7

**Sciter Bootstrap**: for quick starting your desktop app, [download](http://misoftware.rs/Bootstrap/Download) a package with a pre-made IDE project for the C# language, which comes with this library already configured.

Nuget package: https://www.nuget.org/packages/SciterSharp/

## About

This library is a port of Sciter headers to the C# language. [Sciter](http://sciter.com/download/) is a multi-platform HTML engine. With this library you can create C#.NET desktop application using not just HTML, but all the features of Sciter: CSS3, SVG, scripintg, AJAX,... Sciter is free for commercial use.

This binding is all C# code and Marshaling + PInvoke for it's glory.  

License: GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3


##  Requirements

Requires at least .NET 4.5.


##  Usage

In Visual Studio, install it via Nuget package or manually adding a reference to the assembly binary.

For running you desktop app, you need to **make sure that your program can find sciter32/64.dll**. I recommend putting a copy of each DLL in the *bin/Debug/* and *bin/Release/* folders.


## Classes API

The API is a complete OO wrap over the C API making things more intuitive and organized.
There are 2 namespaces:

```SciterSharp``` - Public main instatiable classes.

```SciterSharp.Interop``` - Internal static classes, PInvoke definitions, Sciter ABI.

Here is a summary of the available classes and their mapping over the official SDK C/C++ headers:

- **class SciterWindow**: API for creating a native window by PInvoke/SciterCreateWindow(), loading of HTML page via PInvoke/SciterLoadPage(), and message processing via callback for PInvoke/SciterCreateWindow();
- **abstract class SciterHost**: handling of host notifications generated by Sciter via PInvoke/SciterSetCallback(); attaching of event-handlers; registration of behaviors handlers (behavior factory); call function/eval script;
- **class SciterArchive**: open an archive from a binary array via PInvoke/SciterOpenArchive() and reading of file via PInvoke/SciterGetArchiveItem();
- **class SciterValue**: API over Sciter VALUE for manipulating/interfacing with TIScript (JSON data)
- **class SciterElement**: API over Sciter DOM manipulation (HELEMENT) - status: **INCOMPLETE**
- **abstract class SciterEventHandler**: Sciter event-handler native callback; extend this class for handling Sciter events;


## Todo's (help appreciated) 

- HELEMENT / SciterElement API
- Windows Forms control
- WPF control
- add as C# documentation all the helpful API comments found in the official Sciter SDK C headers
